# rock-paper-scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game created to run in the terminal

When it this project is completed, I hope to:

    * Use for and if loops successfully 
    * Have user be able to input of chosen item in variations of uppercase and lowercase
    * Have the score be recorded and max of five games.
    * This is a test

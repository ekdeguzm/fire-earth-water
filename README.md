# Fire Earth Water

**Link to the live demo found [here](https://ekdeguzm.github.io/fire-earth-water/)**

An implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) curriculum but with elements of nature instead. 

Fire > Earth > Water > Fire.

Created with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## **First stage: Game in the browser console**

The benefits I got from this stage:

   * Deepened knowledge of how functions work with each other.
   * Learned how to input chosen item and keep score. 
   * Enjoyed seeing the importance of creating a struture of the game first before creating UI.

## **Second stage: Creating the UI**

The benefits I got from this stage:

   * How to create buttons out of icons and create a zooming and color changing effect when hovering over.
   * How to register an action after clicking a button and declaring an argument.
   * Learned basic manipulations of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).
   * Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (organization, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones functions).
